# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset and Comparative Assessment of K-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes Algorithms

-----

## Overview

This repository contains the Python Interactive Notebook for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the Iris Dataset. The analysis was undertaken as part of my COMP482: Data Mining Mini project for the respective course.

## About the Project

In this project, I delve into the Iris Dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. The primary goal is to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis, gaining insights into the characteristics of the dataset and preparing it for subsequent modeling.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: The heart of this repository is the Jupyter Notebook where the entire EDA process is documented. From data preprocessing to visualization, each step is explained to ensure transparency and replicability.

2. **Datasets**: The repository includes the Iris Dataset used for analysis. It is essential for reproducing the results and exploring the code.

## Key Steps in the EDA

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, check for outliers, and preprocess the data to ensure its suitability for analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilize various visualization techniques to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and any patterns that may emerge.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to derive meaningful insights into the dataset.

## Comparative Assessment of Algorithms

As a part of the project, a comparative assessment is performed on two machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes. The implementation and evaluation of these algorithms are discussed in detail in the notebook.

## How to Use

To explore the EDA and algorithms implemented, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AayushPokharel/COMP482_Mini_Project.git

2. Change into the Project Directory.

   ```bash
   cd COMP_482_Mini_Project

4. Create and Activate a python virtual environment.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate```

3. Install the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements

4. Open it in Jupyter Notebook

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
